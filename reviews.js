/*Create an array called reviews, which contains review objects. Each object has these properties: reviewerName (string data type), reviewText (string data type), and stars (number data type, 0-5). The array should contain 3-4 review objects. 
Create a function displayReviews that runs on page load. The function should display a Bootstrap card for each review. Each card should display the reviewer's name, the review text, and number of stars. The Bootstrap cards should all display within the <div> with id of "review-cards".
